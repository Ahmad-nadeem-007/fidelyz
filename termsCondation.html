                            such as flights, accommodations, rental cars, packages, or travel insurance (the 'Travel
                            Products'). The Travel Products are owned, controlled or made available by third parties
                            (the 'Travel Providers') either directly (e.g., airline) or as an agent (e.g., online travel

                            not verify the content uploaded by the Travel Providers, it is not possible for us to
                            guarantee the prices displayed on Our Website. Prices change constantly and additional
                            charges (e.g., payment fees, services charges, checked-in luggage fees, local taxes and
                            fees) may apply, so you should always check whether the price asked for a booking is the one
                            you expected. More details here. Some Travel Products may also be sold in another currency

                                back-to-back ticketing (purchasing two or more tickets with overlapping travel dates in
                                order to circumvent minimum stay requirements) and hidden-city ticketing (purchasing tickets
                                including segments which the purchaser does not intend to use in order to circumvent an air
                                carrier's pricing structure), is prohibited by many air carriers. The use of prohibited
                                ticketing practices may result in the air carrier taking actions, including the cancellation
                                of the ticket, denied boarding, revocation of frequent flier miles and other benefits,
                                additional charges to the purchaser's credit card, additional charges collected at the
                                airport, or future invoicing.
